This script contains a list of a few stock market symbols and will make a request to the yahoo finance webpage.
From that request, it then parses the html and finds the current price and change for that stock market symbol.
Lastly, it will write down the symbol price and change into a csv file.

This web scraping was written with Beautiful Soup, requests and csv
